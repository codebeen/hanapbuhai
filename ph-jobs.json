To accelerate their growth, digital financial service providers need a bank that understands their needs, that is built to work through partners, that can move fast.\n\nThis is Netbank’s passion. We provide a full range of banking services to fintech and financial institutions migrating to digital. We book loans originated by alternative lenders, open accounts for ‘banking as a service’ aggregators, manage payments via API, issue cards and provide mobile banking apps. All these services are white labelled, so our partners stay in control of their clients. We already lend to clients of several alternative lenders and provide a complete banking platform for a neobank. We will soon manage payments for a wide range of fintech, issue cards and open ‘purpose- driven’ accounts. We think like a fintech and move like a fintech, to provide services that only a bank can offer. Using Netbank, Filipino fintech can scale, international fintech can enter the Philippines fast, traditional lenders can provide digital financial services to their clients. Netbank provides the tools and the technology so our partners can focus on differentiation, on providing the best possible service to their customers.\n\nNetbank also operates branch operations in its ‘home region’, of Romblon.\n\nVisit www.netbank.ph or contact our team to find out how we can help you.",
